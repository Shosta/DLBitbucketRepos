# DLBitbucketRepos
Download all the repositories that you can access on Bitbucket

This program is made to clone all the repositories that you have on Bitbucket at once.
It is very usefull if you want to statically analyze the code on a security perspective for instance.

You can look for Certificate files, leaked information (like password, logins, keys, etc...). 


And more than that, you can look in the git history if some information where leaked in the past, even if they are not available in the code at the moment.
